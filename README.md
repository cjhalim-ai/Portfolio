## ðŸ‘‹ Hey! Iâ€™m Christy a data practitioner with a heart for analytical storytelling and a knack for designing the perfect target consumer for your brand or product.
With 4+ years of experience, I've been blessed to work with brands such as American Express, Microsoft, Citi, ExxonMobil, TIAA, Levi's, BODYARMOR, and CVS and more.
- ðŸ‘€ I have an ever-curious mind, with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as my next area of self-teaching.
- ðŸŒ± Currently working as a data analyst at [GRIN](https://www.grin.co), the #1 influencer marketing software to help DTC brands manage influencer marketing programs at scale.
- â˜• When Iâ€™m not building data products and solutions - Iâ€™m behind my camera, running my specialty coffee and lifestyle blog. Iâ€™ve partnered with brands such as La Colombe, Our Place, Yamazaki Home, and countless other businesses around the country to create digital content and design influencer marketing campaigns.
