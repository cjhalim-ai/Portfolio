## Context
Airbnb is an online platform that allows people to rent short-term accommodation. This ranges from regular people with a spare bedroom to property management firms who lease multiple rentals. On the one side, Airbnb enables owners to list their space and earn rental money. On the other side, it provides travelers easy access to renting private homes.

Airbnb receives commissions from two sources upon every booking, namely from the hosts and guests. For every booking, Airbnb charges the guest 6-12% of the booking fee. Moreover, Airbnb charges the host 3% for every successful transaction.
